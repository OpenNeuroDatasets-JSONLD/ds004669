# Overview
In this study, fMRI data was recorded while participants had dialogue tasks involving chatting about specific topics, such as self-introduction and favorite classes.
Each participant was scanned for about 27 runs over the course of three to four sessions. 
We constructed voxel-wise modeling, voxel-based encoding models predict BOLD responses in each voxel evoked by features of interest.  To extract contextualized linguistic embeddings for the utterances in the dialogues, we used a pre-trained conversational large language model, GPT-Neox.  We also included additional low-level features (Part-of-speech, morpheme count, and syllable count) in the encoding model estimation and then discarded them for model testing.

# Dataset
## MRI files
The present dataset contains fMRI data from eight subjects. 
Each scanning session consisted of functional (EPI) and anatomical (T1) data. 
The functional EPI images covered the entire brain (TR, 1000 ms; TE, 30 ms; flip angle, 60°; voxel size, 2 × 2 × 2 mm), T1-weighted anatomical reference image for each subject (voxel size, 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm). 

## Features
- GPT-Neox 
- Part-of-speech
- Morpheme count
- Syllable count
